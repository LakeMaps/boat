Units
=====

A units API written in and for [Kotlin].

This project is a self-serving units API written in and for [Kotlin]. It is heavily inspired by [JSR 363] so much so
that it strives to be a strict subset of [JSR 363], not implementing methods on the `Unit` and `Quantity` interfaces
that are not needed by the parent project.
